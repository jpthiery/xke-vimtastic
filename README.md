## Node project setup

Now that your Vim has been configured you are ready to tackle some file editing and navigation

### You need node

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing node versions on your system.

It can be installed liked this:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
```
Note: You may have to manually export the `.nvm` directory.

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Navigating through the project

Start by opening up Vim in the current directory.

```
vim .
```

Vim will open up with Nerdtree showing the directory listing. Go into the `src` directory and enter `index.js`
