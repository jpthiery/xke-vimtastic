## Welcome!

First head over to the `vimrc` branch to configure Vim and to get to know some useful configuration

Check it out locally ```git checkout vimrc```

[vimrc branch](https://github.com/xebia-france/xke-vimtastic/tree/vimrc)

Once you are happy with the configuration, you can try out Vim in a small project

```git checkout node```

[node branch](https://github.com/xebia-france/xke-vimtastic/tree/node)
